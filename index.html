      <h1><img src="logo.png" alt="" width="30"> 2019 UtahJS Survey Results</h1>
      <p>In October of 2019, a survey of UtahJS members was conducted through the group's slack channel around the topics of pay and education. Presented here are an analysis of the results, as well as some commentary, and a link to the raw result data.</p>

      <h2><a name="demographics">Demographics</a></h2>
      <h3>I would consider myself a...</h3>
      <p>This year members were asked to bucket themselves in to job-titles, such as "Junior Developer" or "HR Manager"</p>

      <div id="job-titles-chart" class="chart"></div>

      <p>Also, included in the Other category were (with 1 response each):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content Management/Media Design</li>
        <li>Principal Engineer</li>
        <li>SDET</li>
        <li>Senior and Manager and Lead</li>
        <li>Software Architect Extra-Ordinair!</li>
        <li>Student</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How much experience do people have in different roles?</h3>
      <div id="job-titles-experience" class="chart"></div>
      <p>This box plot shows similar results to previous years, with strong overlap of titles -- especially mid and senior level developers. Some observations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>While the average for "Senior Developer" is 10 years, people are describing themselves with that label with as few as 3 years of experience.</li>
        <li>Junior developer is the narrowest band, with a range of 3 years from least to most experienced.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What are the experience levels for all of the survey respondents?</h3>

      <div id="overall-experience" class="chart"></div>

      <div id="overall-experience-5" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>Gender of respondents...</h3>

      <p>This year the survey asked about gender, with the option of entering their own response in free-form text.</p>

      <div id="gender" class="chart"></div>

      <p>The responses for "other" are:</p>

      <!-- <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><td>Response</td><td>Number</td></tr>
        </thead>
        <tr><td>Non-binary/genderqueer</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Prefer not to say</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Motorboat</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Helicoptor</td><td>2</td></tr>
      </table> -->

      <ul>
        <li>Prefer not to say (1)</li>
        <li>Non-binary (1)</li>
        <li>Non-binary; genderqueer (1)</li>
        <li>Motorboat (1)</li>
        <li>Helicoptor (1)</li>
        <li>Apache Helicotor (1)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Editorial note: Several survey responses were, I'm guessing, made in jest. However, with such a sensitive issue as gender identity, I don't think it would be right to remove or modify any response. They are included above, and I hope it doesn't in any way invalidate or delegitimize the serious and personal "other" responses to this survey.</em></p>

      <h3>Gender comparison to 2018</h3>

      <div id="gender-comparison" class="chart"></div>

      <h2><a name="compensation">Compensation</a></h2>
      <p>This year, the survey included compensation questions about base bay (cash compensation), liquid equity (stock), non-reoccuring bonuses, pay changes from changing employers, as well as important benefits.</p>

      <h3>Total compensation</h3>
      <!-- <p>Survey responses included several students, or people otherwise not earning (or reporting) their income. In this section, those responses will not be included in statistical analysis exept in the first section. Meaning the sum of base cash pay (aka salary), liquid equity, and bonuses across all experience levels is:</p> -->

      <div id="total-comp-with-nones" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Two box plots are shown here: one including responses with zero compensation (students, out of work, taking time off), and one including those with jobs currently.</p>

      <h3>How does total compensation change with experience?</h3>
      <div id="total-comp-by-experience" class="chart full"></div>

      <h3>Of those that received equity or bonuses, what were they?</h3>
      <p>78 of 208 respondents reported receiving equity or a bonus.</p>

      <div id="received-non-cash" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Of those that did receive equity or a cash bonus, what was it?</p>
      <div id="non-cash-comp" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>How does gender relate to compensation?</h3>
      <h4>Showing salary only</h4>

      <div id="salary-by-gender" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Zooming in on the experience area shows the distribution more clearly:</p>
      <div id="salary-by-gender-zoomed" class="chart full"></div>
      <h4>Total Compensation</h4>
      <p>Does the distribution change when equity and bonuses are considered?</p>
      <div id="tc-by-gender" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Zooming in on the experience area shows the distribution more clearly:</p>
      <div id="tc-by-gender-zoomed" class="chart full"></div>

      <h3>How does job title relate to compensation?</h3>
      <div id="comp-by-title" class="chart"></div>
      <h2><a name="education">Education</a></h2>
      <h3>What is the distribution of education types?</h3>
      <p>Survey respondents selected from a pre-defined list of types of education, or "other" with free-form text</p>
      <div id="edu-type" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Other responses inlcuded different certificate programs, high-school only, and mixture of some college & bootcamps</p>
      <h3>Do different education types have different compensation distributions?</h3>
      <div id="comp-by-edu" class="chart"></div>
      <h3>Could compensation distribution differences be explained by experience, rather than education type?</h3>
      <div id="comp-by-edu-exp" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Hover over "bootcamp" in the legend, and observe that the points are all clustered between 0-5 years of experience. While bootcamp graduates have a lower compensation when compared to other education types in general, they are within the same pay range as their peers at that experience level. I believe that this is explained by their years of experience in the industry -- not their education type.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>What type of degrees do respondents have?</h3>
      <div id="degree-type" class="chart"></div>
      <p>While Computer Science Bachelors and Masters degrees remain the largest type of degree held, as a whole, they are a minority to non-computer-science degree holders.</p>
      <h4>"Other" degrees</h4>
      <p>As a category, "other" is larger than CS, MIS, or Business degrees. The degree types vary widely, but include:</p>
      <ul class="column-list">
          <li>Advertising</li>
          <li>Entertainment Business</li>

      <p>To hopefully avoid being a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1138/" target="_blank">"geographic profile map, which is basically just a population map"</a>, here are the results in tabular form</p>

        </tbody>

      <h3>What about remote workers?</h3>
      <p>4 respondents reported living remotely, meaning they live outside of Utah, but participate in UtahJS.</p>
      <p>10 respondents reported working remotely, meaning they work outside of Utah.</p>
      <h2><a name="benefits">Benefits</a></h2>
      <h3>What are common benefits?</h3>
      <p>Respondents were asked about other benefits they thought were particularly good. There were many responses, which were quite varied. Most common were:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Fully-paid health insurance (aka. employer paid premiums) (46)</li>
      <li>Unlimited PTO*  (48)</li>
      <li>Matching 401k (20)</li>
      <li>Good* paid parental leave (18)</li>
      <li>Onsite gym</li>
      <li>Onsite health clinic</li>
      <li>Flexible schedule</li>
      <li>Work from home</li>
      <li>Paid or Catered Lunches</li>
      <li>Education reimbursement</li>
      <li>Gym membership reimbursement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* <em>Jury is still out</em> if this is a benefit for the employer or the employee.</p>
    <p>* What people considered "good" varied. Most responses were between 4-6 weeks, but several were in the 3-4 month range of paid parental leave.</p>
    <h2><a name="raises">Raises</a></h2>
    <h3>How many people received a raise this year?</h3>
    <p>138 respondents reported receiving a raise this year, either at their current employer or by moving to a new employer (raise via moving jobs).</p>
    <div id="raise-received" class="chart"></div>

    <h3>How does receiving a raise at your current employer compare with moving to a new employer?</h3>
    <p></p>
    <div id="raise-vs-move" class="chart"></div>
    <p>This shows the distribution of the responses in terms of dollar amounts. However, a comparison of raises as a percentage of their salary may be more useful:</p>
    <div id="raise-vs-move-box" class="chart"></div>
    <h2><a name="previous">Previous Years Results</a></h2>
    <p>This survey was conducted in 2017 and 2018 with similar questions. Those datasets and analysis can be found at:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2018: <a href="https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-pay-data-2018/" target="_blank">https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-pay-data-2018/</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h2><a name="biases">Caveats & Biases</a></h2>
    <p>Some of my thoughts about this survey, and on ways this survey could be improved</p>
    <h3>Response Numbers</h3>
    <p>There were 208 responses, out of 3000 people in the #general channel (in Slack). This is about 7% of members. For this number of respondents and population size, we could say that we have a 95% confidence level, with a margin of error of about 6%. Not the best, but not the worst either.</p>
    <h3>Self-selection</h3>
    <p>Members of UtahJS self-selected into responding to the survey, and were not randomly sampled. It's not possible to know if there is a segment of UtahJS that was less or more likely to repond. I believe that there is good representation across years of experience, education types, and job titles. However, the representation of women in the survey decreased from last year. I don't know if a smaller percentage of the overall women participated in the survey this year, or perhaps the number of women who participate in UtahJS declined. In either case, the gender representation was not very diverse.</p>
    <h3>Survivorship bias</h3>
    <p>One particular bias that I would be concerned about in survey responses is survivorship bias, especially as it relates to education data. For example, if an individual who attended a bootcamp, and for a short time participated in UtahJS, but for whatever reason stopped participating (couldn't find a job, moved locations, etc), this persons experience would not be captured in the survey results. Or to put another way, the only data we have is for individuals who are successful enough in their careers to continue.</p>
    <p>Because of this bias, we need to be careful about how we understand the survey results. It would not be correct to say that "people who are self-taught make $$ salary," rather "people who are in UtahJS who were self-taught make $$ salary," because those no longer participating aren't here to report their data.</p>
    <p>Checkout one of my favorite-to-recommend articles for more info on survivorship bias: <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/" target="_blank">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/</a></p>
